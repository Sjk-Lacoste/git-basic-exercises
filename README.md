Some programming languages actually have the transition from one 
programming language to another in mind. This is why it is so much 
easier to learn a lot of programming languages — just by learning a 
single one.

“Once upon a time” is something (dare I say) even a child might 
understand. It addresses the developer (by referring to childhood 
memories), while theoretically doing the same thing. This is what I 
consider “having the human to coding language transition” in mind.
